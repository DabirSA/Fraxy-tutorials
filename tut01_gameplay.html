		<div class="categorytitle">Tutorial 01: How to Play FRAXY</div>
		<p>This is the first in a series of tutorials about FRAXY. This tutorial covers basic FRAXY gameplay.</p>
		<p>By the end of this tutorial, you should understand how to move, aim, shoot, and how to choose a boss to fight.</p>
		<p>Please note that virtually every element of this gameplay is at liberty to be modified by the designer of the boss you are facing or the Try you are playing. If a boss creator wants to make it so that firing your weapons destroys you and boosting slows you down, they can do that. This tutorial describes unmodified gameplay only.</p>
		<br />
		<div class="style_center">- Basic Gameplay -</div>
		<br />
		<p>Fraxy is a top-down shoot-em-up, or shmup, game.</p>
		<p>In FRAXY, the player is able to move and rotate freely on a 2D plane. Their objective is to battle a powerful boss machine, evading its attacks and firing back to break through its defenses and ultimately, destroy the core at the heart of the machine.
		
		<p>Before running the game for the first time, you should run config.exe. This is the game's settings configurator, and it is here that you can adjust options such as various visual settings, font size, control bindings and so on. In particular, take note of the "View change" keybind. You will need it later. Once you believe you are comfortable with your settings, feel free to run fraxy.exe.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-mainmenu.png" alt="This is an image of the FRAXY main menu. The background is a cloudy pattern. Text in the top-left corner says 'FRAXY'. Text in the top-right corner says 'Normal Style'. In the bottom left, under a 'Main Menu' heading, there are three menu options: 'Free Play', 'Try' and 'Exit'. Below them, there is the text 'Free play is for practice and training.'" />
		<p>This is the game's main menu. The first option, Free Play, lets you simply face a boss of your choosing. The second, Try, lets you load a Try script file to attempt a scored run of a pre-made challenge.</p>
		<p>For now, let's stick to Free Play. Click the Free Play button.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-menu.png" alt="This is an image of the FRAXY Free Play menu. The previous options are gone, replaced with, in the top left of the screen, 'Random', 'Select', 'Clipboard', 'Option' and 'Return'." />
		<p>The last button here, Return, will take you back to the main menu. The Option button allows you to configure various settings about your Free Play session. The remaining three are different methods for selecting the boss you want to fight.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Random option selects bosses at random from your random folder. By default, this is the 'enemy' folder. Each time you defeat a boss, another is selected at random to appear in its place. This option is best for simply jumping in and playing the game without having to think about what to fight.</li>
			<li>The Select option allows you to select one boss from anywhere on your computer. Boss filenames end with .fed. Each time you defeat the boss, another instance of it will appear in its place. This option is best for practicing against one boss in particular.</li>
			<li>The Clipboard option pastes boss data directly into the game from your clipboard. FRAXY enemy data is stored as plain text. You can copy this data directly from the editor, from inside a .fed file, or from anywhere that provides it to you in text form. Each time you defeat a boss, the data on your clipboard is checked again. If you do not have enemy data on your clipboard, nothing will load in, but the game will keep checking until you do. This option is best for quickly testing changes you've made in the editor.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For this tutorial, we will be using the Clipboard option.</p>
		<p>Some enemy data is provided below. Select all of the text in the grey box and copy it (Right-click and select "Copy", or press CTRL+C on your keyboard).</p>
		<object class="fed" type="text/plain" data="tut01-testenemy.fed"></object>
		<p>Now switch back to FRAXY, and click the Clipboard button. You should load into something like the below encounter.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-spawn.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode immediately after spawning in. The player ship is in the center of the screen. To its left, two orange bullets are flying past, heading towards the top of the screen. In the bottom right, a radar display shows a red shape to the south of the player, off-screen." />
		<p>You will notice that the boss is firing its weapons from off-screen. This enemy simply fires straight forwards, so you can ignore it for now.</p>
		<p>You will also notice that the text which appeared when the boss spawned referred to it as "Rank 1". "Rank" is the difficulty of the boss, and it goes from 1 (easiest) to 100 (hardest). As Rank increases, bosses move more quickly and their attacks become more dangerous.</p>
		<p>Take some time to get used to moving around and shooting. By default, you move with the WASD keys, and aim with the mouse. Left-click to fire your weapon, and right-click to boost. Boosting gives you a burst of speed when you first activate it, but you don't have to keep pressing it - just holding it will let you move more quickly.</p>
		<p>Notice that as you move your mouse around, the camera moves a bit to stay ahead of your ship. If you find this effect disorienting, you can press the "View change" button to keep the camera centered on your ship. If you have forgotten what the "View change" button is, you can run config.exe and check your input bindings at any time.</p>
		<p>In the top left, you can see your equipment slots. By default, your first slot contains the Bullet weapon, and your second slot contains Vulcan. Switch between these weapons, and observe the difference in their behaviour. You have five slots, which can contain both weapons and support equipment. You will learn how to change the contents of your equipment slots later.</p>
		<p>It is time for you to approach and engage the boss. In the bottom-right of your screen, you can see a radar display. The box shape in the radar shows the area you are looking at, and the red shape indicates the location of an enemy. Move towards that red shape now. You should encounter something like this.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-meetboss.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode. The player ship is in the center of the screen. Immediately below and to the right of the player, there is a boss enemy. The boss consists of a large circular core with a blue orb at its center, with a long rigid arm extending out from each side of it. One arm has a gun at the end, while the other has a laser emitter at the end, both pointing straight forwards. They are far too far apart to present any danger to the player." />
		<p>This is a very simple boss. It consists of a core, some structural elements, and two different weapons. Different cores have different movement patterns available, but for this tutorial, the core's movement has been stopped.</p>
		<p>In the bottom left of the screen, you will see a green meter. This is your energy meter, which acts as both your health and your ammunition. If it reaches 0, your ship is destroyed. Your ship is also destroyed if you collide with any solid boss parts, regardless of your energy level.</p>
		<p>Try firing your weapons. Firing your default bullet weapon causes the meter to dip only very slightly, while firing the vulcan weapon in slot 2 causes it to dip a little more. Energy regenerates over time, and for these simple, weak weapons, it regenerates faster than your weapons drain it. Stronger weapons are available, and these weapons drain much more energy when fired.</p>
		<p>Try standing in front of the boss's bullet weapon. At this low difficulty, the two shots it fires should not be enough to destroy you. Notice how quickly energy regenerates. Try firing your weapons while your energy is partially drained to see how it regenerates more slowly.</p>
		<p>By default, most parts in FRAXY can be destroyed if they take enough damage. Try firing at one of the boss's weapons. Notice that parts flash white when they take damage, and as they get close to being destroyed, they begin to flicker red.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-bosshurt.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode. Little has changed from the previous image, but the laser emitter at the end of the boss's arm is now tinted red." />
		<p>Continue to fire at this part until it is destroyed. At higher Ranks, destroyed parts fire revenge bullets towards you, but at this low Rank, you will not encounter revenge bullets.</p>
		<p>Destroying the weapon part on its own had no additional effect. This is because it had no child parts. In FRAXY, each part, except the boss's core, has a 'parent' part. A 'parent' may have multiple 'children'. If a part is destroyed, all of its children are also destroyed. You can generally tell what is connected to what just by looking, but it is up to the boss creator to make these parent-child connections make sense.</p>
		<p>In this case, the parents of the weapons are the struts they're connected to. Try shooting at the strut that the other weapon is attached to.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-bossveryhurt.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode. The boss is now missing its laser emitter, as well as the bullet weapon and the end of the strut on which the bullet weapon was mounted." />
		<p>Notice that when you destroyed this strut, it took the weapon attached to it with it. This is called 'chain destruction'. On higher Ranks, every part destroyed in the chain would fire its own revenge bullets at you. If playing for score, you also gain more points for destroying parts in a chain than you do destroying them one by one.</p>
		<p>Not all parts can be destroyed by the player. On this boss, the inner halves of the struts have been made indestructible. Try shooting at them.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-bossnothurt.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode. The player is firing at the inner half of one of the struts. Their bullets are visibly having no effect on the boss." />
		<p>Notice how your bullets bounce off, having no effect. The only way to destroy these indestructible parts is to destroy their parent. It is now time to turn our attention to the core.</p>
		<p>Every boss is built around a core. Some may include multiple cores, or have special cores which allow parts to break off and act independently, but destroying cores is always your main objective. As all parts form part of a chain connecting back to the core, destroying the core will destroy all remaining boss parts.</p>
		<p>Destroy the core.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-bossdying.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode. The core has been destroyed, indicated by explosions all over it." /><br />
		<p>The boss has now been destroyed.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-bossdead.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode. The boss is now gone. In its place is a glowing mass of energy with three arms. Each arm has an orb at the end. One orb is red, and contains the letter P. One is green, and contains the letter £E. One is blue, and contains the letter R." />
		<p>The destroyed core has dropped an item. This item presents you with a choice of three powerup items. The red P increases the level of your currently-equipped weapon. The green E increases your energy level. The blue R increases your energy regeneration rate. Weapons, energy and regeneration all begin at level 1, and have a maximum level of 5</p>
		<p>Fly into the powerup you prefer to collect it. Alternatively, you can fly into the energy mass at the center and remain there for a few seconds to gain a temporary powerup referred to as "Over soll power". Over soll power boosts the level of all of your weapons for a few seconds, and can even boost them beyond the normal maximum level of 5.</p>
		<p>
		<p>If you have not copied anything else onto your clipboard since spawning the boss, a second copy of it should have spawned. If it has not, copy the boss data above again and return to the game.</p>
		<p>Notice that the Rank of this boss is slightly higher than the previous one. It is now firing slightly more quickly than before. If it could move, it would also move around slightly faster.</p>
		<p>Continue destroying this boss as long as you need to to grasp the game's controls. When you are done, press the Escape key.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplay-pausemenu.png" alt="This is an image of FRAXY's Free Play mode. The player and boss are still on-screen, but the visuals are slightly darker. At the center of the screen, under the heading 'Pause Menu', there are five options: 'Continue', 'Player status', 'Clean up', 'Return to main menu' and 'Exit'." /><br />
		<p>This is the Free Play pause menu. Gameplay is paused while on this menu. Pressing "Continue" resumes play. Pressing "Return to main menu" will return you to the main menu, leaving the boss active in the background. Pressing "Exit" quits the game entirely.</p>
		<p>"Player status" lets you modify your weapons and their levels, as well as your energy and regeneration levels, and even select a different ship type. Different ships have different stats, as well as slightly different weapon behaviours. In particular, the special 'BulletHell' ship requires no energy to fire any of its weapons, and receives a different set of items when it destroys a core, but it is destroyed instantly on taking any amount of damage.</p>
		<p>Pressing "Clean up" will do nothing at first. However, when gameplay resumes, or when you return to the main menu, the boss will immediately self-destruct. If you have resumed gameplay, a new boss will immediately spawn if possible. Destroying a boss this way does not make it drop an item, or increase your Rank.</p>
		<p>It's time for you to fight a real opponent. You can return to the main menu, then choose a boss from the list by selecting "Free Play", then "Select". Or, remain in Clipboard mode and copy the enemy data below to fight the boss "Double-X".</p>

		<p>How did you do? Don't be disheartened if you struggled at first - FRAXY is primarily about creating bosses. It's OK to leave fighting them to other players who have more practice than you do.</p>
		<p>Now that you understand how the game works, you're ready to start making your own bosses. Click the link below to proceed to the next tutorial.</p>
