		<p>This is the first in a series of tutorials about FRAXY. This tutorial covers basic FRAXY gameplay.</p>
		<p>Please note that virtually every element of this gameplay is at liberty to be modified by the designer of the boss you are facing. This tutorial describes unmodified gameplay only.</p>

		<br />
		<p>Fraxy is a top-down shoot-em-up, or shmup, game.</p>
		<p>In FRAXY, the player is able to move and rotate freely on a 2D plane. Their objective is to battle a powerful boss machine, evading its attacks and firing back to break through its defenses and ultimately, destroy the core at the heart of the machine.
		
		<p>Before running the game for the first time, you should run config.exe. This is the game's settings configurator, and it is here that you can adjust options such as various visual settings, font size, control bindings and so on. Once you believe you are comfortable with your settings, feel free to run fraxy.exe.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-mainmenu.png" alt="The FRAXY main menu. " />
		<p>This is the game's main menu. The first option, Free Play, lets you face a boss of your choosing. The second, Try, lets you load a more complex Try script file. For now, let's stick to Free Play. Click the Free Play button.</p>
		<img class="fraxyss" src="tut01-freeplaymenu.png" alt="The FRAXY Free Play menu. The previous options are gone, replaced with, in the top left of the screen, 'Random', 'Select', 'Clipboard', 'Option' and 'Return'." />
		<p>The last button here, Return, will take you back to the main menu. The Option button allows you to configure various settings about your Free Play session. The remaining three are different methods for selecting your boss.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Random option selects bosses at random from your random folder. By default, this is the 'enemy' folder containing all of your boss files. Each time you defeat a boss, another is selected at random to appear in its place. This option is best for simply playing the game without having to think about what to fight.</li>
			<li>The Select option allows you to select one boss from anywhere. Boss filenames end with .fed. Each time you defeat the boss, another instance of it will appear in its place. This option is best for practicing against one boss in particular.</li>
			<li>The Clipboard option pastes boss data directly into the game from your clipboard. FRAXY enemy data is stored as plain text. You can copy this data directly from the editor, from inside a .fed file, or from anywhere that provides it to you in text form. Each time you defeat a boss, the data on your clipboard is checked again. This option is best for quickly testing changes.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Fraxy is a top-down shoot-em-up, or shmup, game.</p>
		<p>In FRAXY, the player is able to move and rotate freely on a 2D plane. The player also has access to a boost button, which provides a burst of speed when pressed and makes their movement faster while held.</p>
		<p>The player has an energy meter, and five slots for weapons and support items. Firing most weapons costs energy, with more powerful weapons draining more energy. Some more powerful weapons also have their own cooldown timer.</p>
		<p>Taking damage also drains the player's energy. When the player's energy reaches 0, their ship is destroyed. Energy regenerates over time.</p>
		<p>In general, the player will be facing one boss at a time. The player's objective is to destroy the boss, which usually means destroying the core the boss is built around. Other parts of the boss may also be destructible. Parts are built off each other in a tree-like structure, and when a part is destroyed, all of its child parts will also be destroyed.</p>
		<p>The player has a choice of several ship types. Each ship type has different stats and weapon behaviours - for example, the basic Bullet weapon is a long stream of green bullets as most ship types, but a faster, shorter-range stream of yellow bullets when using the Quicker type. The special BulletHell ship type does not use the energy system - firing its weapons is free, but it is destroyed immediately on taking any amount of damage.</p>
		<p>Bosses have a rank from 1 to 100. This is essentially a difficulty scale, with 1 being the easiest and 100 being the hardest. At higher ranks, bosses will move and fire more quickly.</p>
